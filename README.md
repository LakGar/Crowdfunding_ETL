# Crowdfunding ETL Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline to process data related to crowdfunding campaigns. Using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **PostgreSQL**, the pipeline extracts data from Excel files, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a relational database for further analysis. The final database contains information about campaign categories, subcategories, individual campaigns, and campaign contacts.

## Objectives

1. **Extract Data**:

   - Load data from two Excel files: `crowdfunding.xlsx` and `contacts.xlsx`.

2. **Transform Data**:

   - Process and clean data to create structured DataFrames for:
     - Categories
     - Subcategories
     - Campaigns
     - Contacts
   - Generate unique identifiers for categories and subcategories.
   - Format and clean campaign data (e.g., convert dates, clean numeric fields).
   - Parse and structure contact information.

3. **Load Data**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database with properly defined tables and relationships.
   - Import cleaned and transformed data into the database.

## Deliverables

### Category and Subcategory DataFrames

- **Category DataFrame**:

  - Contains a unique `category_id` (e.g., `cat1`, `cat2`) and corresponding category titles.
  - Exported to `category.csv`.

- **Subcategory DataFrame**:
  - Contains a unique `subcategory_id` (e.g., `subcat1`, `subcat2`) and corresponding subcategory titles.
  - Exported to `subcategory.csv`.

### Campaign DataFrame

- Includes details such as:
  - Campaign ID (`cf_id`), contact ID, company name, description, goal, pledged amount, outcome, backers count, country, currency, launch date, and end date.
  - `category_id` and `subcategory_id` link the campaigns to their categories and subcategories.
- Exported to `campaign.csv`.

### Contacts DataFrame

- Contains structured contact information:
  - Contact ID, first name, last name, and email.
- Extracted from `contacts.xlsx` using Python dictionaries or regular expressions.
- Exported to `contacts.csv`.

### Crowdfunding Database

- Designed and created using PostgreSQL:
  - Includes tables for categories, subcategories, campaigns, and contacts.
  - Proper primary and foreign keys define relationships.
- CSV files are imported into the respective tables.
- Data verification through `SELECT *` queries.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Data extraction and transformation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for loading and querying data.
- **QuickDBD**: Tool for creating the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and running the ETL process.

---

## Results

- **ETL Pipeline**: Successfully extracts, transforms, and loads data into a relational database.
- **Database Schema**: Includes well-defined tables with relationships to support querying and analysis.
- **CSV Outputs**: Data is exported in structured formats for reproducibility and future use.
